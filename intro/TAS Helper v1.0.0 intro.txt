Can't Catch That Spinner Stun?
Introducing... TAS Helper!

Previously known as Spinner Indicator, a script based on Celeste Console Debug mod, now becomes an individual mod!
Comparing against Spinner Indicator, you can now use hotkeys or open Mod Options to change settings.

Features:
(1). Show Countdown of Hazards, i.e. how many frames later, the Spinner/Lightning/DustBunny will be (un)collidable.

(2a). Show Load Ranges: a 256px * 256px lime square around player (NearPlayer Range), and a yellow rectangle around the camera (InView Range).

usage: in the following, let bool NearPlayer = inside the NearPlayer Range, bool InView = inside the InView Range.
for Crystal Static Spinner, if it's visible, it sets that Collidable = NearPlayer every 3f, and sets that Visible = InView every 15f; if it's invisible, it becomes uncollidable and sets Visible = InView every frame.
for Lightning, it checks not InView and deactivate (from collidable to uncollidable) every 15f, and checks InView and activate (from uncollidable to collidable) every 3f.
for Dust Bunny, it sets that collidable = NearPlayer every 3f, after its sprite is estableshed.

(2b). Show the Center of Spinner and Dust Bunny (using a lime cross).
Show 'InViewCollider' of Lightning. (a lime rectangle whose topleft is (1px,1px) away from the topleft of Lightning's hitbox, and whose bottomright is same as that of Lightning's hitbox.)
The Spinner/Dust Bunny is considered to be inside the Load Range, if its Center is inside or on the outer boundary of the Load Range.
The Lightning is InView, if any pixel of the InViewCollider is inside or on the outer boundary of InView Range.

(3). Redraw the collider of Crystal Spinner, also clear the sprites of spinner and refill it, make it less ugly and crowded.

Remark: More functions related to TAS are WIP, that's why I rename it as TAS Helper.
